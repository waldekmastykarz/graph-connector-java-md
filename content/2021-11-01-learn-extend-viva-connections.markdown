We've just launched a new learning path on MS Learn to show you how you can use your existing web development skills to [extend Microsoft Viva Connections](https://aka.ms/extend-viva-connections). Here's why I think it'll interest you.

Viva Connections is the gateway to the modern employee experience. As more and more organizations started working remotely/hybrid, they realized they need a better way to engage with their employees and keep them up-to-date. This is where Viva Connections comes in. It's a turn-key solution that's a part of Microsoft 365 and which aggregates information from different sources and puts them in front of employees on desktop and mobile.

Many organizations are very interested in Microsoft Viva and Viva Connections. Not only do they want to start using it, but also extend it to their needs to make it even more relevant to their employees. And as a partner and developer that's a great opportunity that you should take advantage of.

You can use your existing web development skills and extend Viva Connections with custom functionality. Using Microsoft Graph you can bring data and insights from Microsoft 365 to people's fingertips. And by connecting to your custom APIs, you can bring in your line of business data as well!

To show you what's possible and how to get started, we put together a learning path on MS Learn. [Give it a try](https://aka.ms/extend-viva-connections), and I'm looking forward to hearing how you like it and what you'll build next.
