_When you use apps for work, they rarely show you all the data that you need to get the full context of your work. And that's a shame because that information is often readily available to you, and could be integrated into your app._

Last week, I wrote an article about what I've been seeing a lot in the ecosystem: most work apps focus on their purpose, but miss context data from the workplace, that people need to complete the scenario. As a result, we need to open multiple apps and switch between them back and forth to complete our work. And that's a shame, because it comes at a high cost of focus and productivity.
