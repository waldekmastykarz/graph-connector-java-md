Learn how you can build a simple personal assistant in under 10 minutes that'll show a Microsoft 365 user the meetings they have left for the day.

## Show upcoming meetings for a Microsoft 365 user

Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you [how you can build in **just 10 minutes** a simple personal assistant that shows upcoming meetings for the signed-in user](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-show-upcoming-meetings-for-a-microsoft-365-user/).

Showing upcoming meetings is a common scenario when integrating Microsoft 365 in work applications. It shows you how to get information from the user's calendar and check their availability for a particular time slot. And it's also a great way to get started with building apps on Microsoft 365.

The tutorial shows you the basics of setting up auth in a single-page app and using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to connect to the Microsoft Graph API. It also demonstrates working with calendar views and formatting dates.

Give it a try, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think.
