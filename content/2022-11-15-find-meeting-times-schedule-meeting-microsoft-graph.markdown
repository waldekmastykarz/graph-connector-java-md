In my [last newsletter](/build-first-app-microsoft-365/), I shared with you a few resources to help you get started building apps for Microsoft 365. If you work with an organization that uses Microsoft 365 for work, you've got **a great opportunity to use your developer skills and bring data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 into your work apps**.

Recently I've been working on another app that shows how you'd **find meeting times and schedule a meeting for you and other people in your organization**. This is a common scenario for work apps, and while it's available in Outlook, having it directly in the work app helps your colleagues stay in the flow of work.

üìù Check out the [article I published about this scenario on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/find-meeting-time-schedule-meeting-microsoft-365/).

üì∫ Here's also a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cilY7Ouu9E&list=PLR9nK3mnD-OUQOW86tT5dkCRQAVGY7DlH&index=2) from a recent community call where I showed the app in action.

üëæ And if you're interested in digging into it some more, [here's the code](https://github.com/waldekmastykarz/mgt-spa-findmeetingtimes).

**Remember, the best way to check the app out, is to see it running. Follow the setup steps in the readme and run it on your tenant.**

I've got some more ideas for new demos that I'll be working on in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for more updates. Meanwhile, if you've got any questions, don't hesitate to reach out by leaving a comment.
